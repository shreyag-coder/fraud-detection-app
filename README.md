# Fraud Detection App (PaySim Mobile Money Dataset)

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for **financial fraud detection**.
The goal is to predict whether a given transaction is **fraudulent (`isFraud = 1`)** or
**legitimate (`isFraud = 0`)** based on transaction metadata from a mobile-money system.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection** dataset
generated by the **PaySim** mobile money simulator and published on Kaggle by
**Edgar López-Rojas**:

> López-Rojas, E. *Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection*. Kaggle  
> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1

On Kaggle, this dataset is released under the  
**Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)** license.

Because the raw CSV is ~500 MB, it is **not stored in this repository**.

### Columns

Typical columns in the PaySim dataset:

- `step` – time step in hours from the start of the simulation (1 step = 1 hour).
- `type` – transaction type: `CASH_IN`, `CASH_OUT`, `DEBIT`, `PAYMENT`, `TRANSFER`.
- `amount` – transaction amount in local currency.
- `nameOrig` – ID of the customer initiating the transaction.
- `oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrg` – origin account balance before and after the transaction.
- `nameDest` – ID of the destination account (customer or merchant).
- `oldbalanceDest`, `newbalanceDest` – destination account balance before and after the transaction.
- `isFraud` – **target label**: 1 if the transaction is fraudulent, 0 otherwise.
- `isFlaggedFraud` – rule-based flag for suspicious transactions.

In the simulation, most fraud is **account-takeover + transfer / cash-out**
fraud: attackers move money from a compromised account and then withdraw it.

### How to download and place the data

1. Go to Kaggle and open the dataset:  
   **Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection** (PaySim).

2. Download the main CSV file (often named
   `PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv` or similar).

3. In this repo, create a `data/` folder and put the file inside:
